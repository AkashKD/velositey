Known Bugs/Issues
----------
* Hitting 'Save Icon' button and then closing without saving when Favicons or Mapicons aren't open will close your current active document without warning 
* Save preview as JPG button does not overwrite older JPG's in some instances

Disclaimer: To get the save JPG to work, you must have saved your PSD in a certain folder structure. Look at the "Proofs" folder for more details on how to structure this folder. This is the case due to internal reasons within our workflow.
