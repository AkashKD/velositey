Installation
----------
#Place 'Velositey' folder in 'Adobe Photoshop CS6/Plug-ins/Panels' or 'Adobe Photoshop CC/Plug-ins/Panels'
#Launch Photoshop CC
#In Photoshop, go to 'Window > Extensions > Velositey'

Please note: Make sure the folder you copy to your “Panels” folder is named “Velositey” NOT “Velositey_XX_v1.1” or it will not work

Tools Instructions
----------
*Measure Height:*
#Select an area with the Marquee (M) tool
#Hit the "Measure Height" button

Velositey will measure the height of the selection and publish it onto the document in the "Dimensions" layer set.

*Measure Width:*
#Select an area with the Marquee (M) tool
#Hit the "Measure Width" button

Velositey will measure the width of the selection and publish it onto the document in the "Dimensions" layer set.

*Measure Both:*
#Select an area with the Marquee (M) tool
#Hit the "Measure Height & Width" button

Velositey will measure both the height and width of the selection and publish them onto the document in the "Dimensions" layer set. 

*Type Specifications:*
#Select a type layer
#Hit the "Font Specifications" tool

Velositey will now mark the layer with a number and publish the font family, weight, colour and size in a box on the far left of the document.  

*JPG & PNG buttons (Exporting with CC only):*
#Select a layer or layer set
#Hit the "JPG" or "PNG" button

Velositey will now assign ".jpg80%" or ".png" to the end of the layer name (requires Generate > Image Assets to be turned on before or afterwards to export images).
