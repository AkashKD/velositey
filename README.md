Installation
----------
1. Place 'Velositey' folder in 'Adobe Photoshop CS6/Plug-ins/Panels' or 'Adobe Photoshop CC/Plug-ins/Panels'
2. Launch Photoshop CC
3. In Photoshop, go to 'Window > Extensions > Velositey'

Please note: Make sure the folder you copy to your “Panels” folder is named “Velositey” NOT “Velositey_XX_v1.1” or it will not work

Tools Instructions
----------
Measure Height:
1. Select an area with the Marquee (M) tool
2. Hit the "Measure Height" button

Velositey will measure the height of the selection and publish it onto the document in the "Dimensions" layer set.

Measure Width:
1. Select an area with the Marquee (M) tool
2. Hit the "Measure Width" button

Velositey will measure the width of the selection and publish it onto the document in the "Dimensions" layer set.

Measure Both:
1. Select an area with the Marquee (M) tool
2. Hit the "Measure Height & Width" button

Velositey will measure both the height and width of the selection and publish them onto the document in the "Dimensions" layer set. 

Type Specifications:
1. Select a type layer
2. Hit the "Font Specifications" tool

Velositey will now mark the layer with a number and publish the font family, weight, colour and size in a box on the far left of the document.  

JPG & PNG buttons (Exporting with CC only):
1. Select a layer or layer set
2. Hit the "JPG" or "PNG" button

Velositey will now assign ".jpg80%" or ".png" to the end of the layer name (requires Generate > Image Assets to be turned on before or afterwards to export images).
